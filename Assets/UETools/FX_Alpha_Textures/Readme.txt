Thanks for purchasing UETools FX Alpha Textures!

Package Contents:
=================
- Materials
- PreRendered_Samples
- Textures

Materials:
==========
Materials linked with corresponding textures and additive/translucent shaders, ready to use with particle systems.

PreRendered_Samples:
====================
10 pre-rendered particle effects just for demonstration what can be achieved with this set :) (of course you can make much better effects)

Textures:
=========
/BlackAndWhite - RGB textures (without alpha channel) for use with additive shader
/Translucent   - RGBA textures for use with transparent shader

Tips:
=====
If you are making effects for mobile devices, especially low performance models, B&W textures with additive shader are much cheaper to render than RGBA with translucent shader. Keep it in your mind.
Don't forget to set best compression quality (e.g. PVRTC 4bits "Best" for iOS, ...), otherwise the effects might look ugly.
